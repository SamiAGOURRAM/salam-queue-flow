-- Alternative: Remove the patient JOIN from absent_patients queries
-- Use this if you don't want to change the FK constraint

-- The code would change from:
-- patient:profiles(id, full_name, phone_number)
-- to just not loading patient info, or loading it separately

-- This is just documentation, the actual fix is in Option 1
