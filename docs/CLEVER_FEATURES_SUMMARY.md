## 🏆 Trust & Reputation System (Vinted-Style)

### **1. Direct Booking for Trusted Patients** ⭐ GAME CHANGER

**Problem**: Every booking requires a phone call (annoying, time-consuming)  
**Solution**: Trusted patients skip phone confirmation

**How It Works**:
- Patient with trust score > 70: Books directly, confirmed immediately
- Patient with trust score < 70: Requires phone confirmation

**Impact**:
- ✅ 60%+ reduction in phone calls for clinics
- ✅ 50%+ faster booking for trusted patients
- ✅ Incentive to maintain good behavior
- ✅ Premium feature: Clinics can require trusted patients only

**Moroccan Context**:
- Most competitors require phone calls for ALL bookings
- This is a **major differentiator** for good patients
- Clinics save time and attract quality patients

### **2. Smart Cancellation Penalty** 🕐

**Problem**: Last-minute cancellations hurt clinics  
**Solution**: Penalty based on notice time (fair system)

**How It Works**:
- **> 48 hours notice**: No penalty (you're considerate!)
- **24-48 hours**: -1 point (minor issue)
- **2-24 hours**: -2 points (moderate issue)
- **< 2 hours**: -5 points (severe, like no-show)

**UX Enhancement**:
```
Cancel Appointment?
⚠️ Canceling < 24h before will affect your trust score (-2)
Your current score: 95/100 → 93/100 after canceling

[Cancel Anyway] [Reschedule Instead] ← Smart suggestion
```

```

**Impact**:

- **5 negative reviews** in 60 days → Investigation started
- **10 negative reviews** in 90 days → Serious investigation
- **20 negative reviews** OR < 3.0 average → Potential ban

**Process**:
1. System automatically flags
2. Platform team reviews evidence
3. Clinic can respond/contest
