# 🎯 ACTION REQUIRED - End Day Feature

## ⚠️ You Must Do This Now

### 1. Apply the Database Migration (CRITICAL)

The new feature **will not work** until you run this SQL in Supabase.

**Steps:**
1. Open [Supabase Dashboard](https://supabase.com/dashboard)
2. Go to **SQL Editor**
3. Click **New Query**
4. Copy the ENTIRE contents of this file:
   ```
   supabase/migrations/20251026000002_end_day_rpc.sql
   ```
5. Paste into SQL Editor
6. Click **Run** (or press Cmd/Ctrl + Enter)

**Expected Result:**
```
Success. No rows returned.
```

**Verify It Worked:**
```sql
-- Run this query:
SELECT * FROM clinic_day_closures LIMIT 1;

-- Should return: Empty table (no error)
```

---

### 2. Regenerate TypeScript Types (Optional but Recommended)

This fixes the red squiggly lines in VS Code.

**Command:**
```bash
# Find your project ID first:
# Supabase Dashboard → Project Settings → General → Reference ID

# Then run:
npx supabase gen types typescript --project-id YOUR_PROJECT_ID > src/integrations/supabase/types.ts
```

**Alternative (if using local Supabase):**
```bash
supabase gen types typescript --local > src/integrations/supabase/types.ts
```

**Note:** The code works even without this step. This just makes TypeScript happy.

## 🧪 How to Test

### After applying migration:

1. **Go to Clinic Queue page** in your app
2. **Look for the RED button** that says "End Day"
3. **Create some test appointments** (if queue is empty)
4. **Click "End Day"**
5. **Follow the dialogs** (preview → confirmation)
6. **Watch appointments change** from waiting → no-show

### SQL Testing (Safe Preview):

```sql
-- This is READ-ONLY, won't change anything:
SELECT get_day_closure_preview(
  'YOUR_STAFF_ID'::UUID,
  'YOUR_CLINIC_ID'::UUID,
  CURRENT_DATE
);

-- Should return counts like:
-- {"totalAppointments": 5, "waiting": 3, "inProgress": 1, ...}
```

## 🎯 Where to Find Everything

### The Red Button:
```
App → Clinic Dashboard → Queue Management

You'll see it right below the stats cards:
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│ [Waiting] [In Progress] [Absent]│
└─────────────────────────────────┘
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│ 🔴 End Day                  [RED]│ ← HERE!
│ Close queue & finalize...       │
└─────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Documentation:
- **Quick Start:** `END_DAY_QUICK_START.md` (read this first!)
- **Full Docs:** `END_DAY_FEATURE_README.md` (complete reference)
- **Summary:** `END_DAY_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` (what was built)
- **Tests:** `supabase/test_end_day.sql` (SQL testing)

## 🚨 Common Issues

### "Button doesn't appear"
**Cause:** Migration not applied  
**Fix:** Do Step 1 above (apply migration)

### "RPC function not found"
**Cause:** Migration not applied  
**Fix:** Do Step 1 above (apply migration)

### "Red squiggly lines in VS Code"
